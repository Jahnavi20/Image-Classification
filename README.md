# Image Classification
## Introduction
The aim of this project is to help identify whether a specific flower is toxic or not. Aconitum, also known as wolfsbane, is the first flower on the list of lethal flowers. Most deadly flowers are believed to be beautiful. However, not all beautiful flowers are toxic. Unfortunately, people may be more likely to smell or touch a flower when it looks appealing, resulting in exposure to toxins, such as in the case of aconitum. To achive this we aew using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of flowers as toxic or non-toxic.
